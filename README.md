### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Raphael Carolo dos Santos, I'm 26 years old and I live in RibeirÃ£o Preto - SP - Brazil.
 - I am currently working as a Biology and Science teacher in an innovation and technology project.
 - I'm here on GitHub to learn python and backend, because I believe that knowledge can help me in my current job and to get new opportunities.
- Unfortunately at the moment there isn't much I can help with as my studies are in their infancy, but I promise to update this section as soon as I feel able.
- You can ask me everything about biology and education and I'll be at your disposal!
- Fun Fact: I'm a fan of anime and superhero movies, I love games and intend to develop them one day.
